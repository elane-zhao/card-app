# The Legends Card Gallery App

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Node version v14.16.1 and the Angular CLI version 11.2.11 installed.

Run `npm i` and `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running Unit Tests

I added unit tests to the card-gallery component, the code coverage is 100% :)

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
